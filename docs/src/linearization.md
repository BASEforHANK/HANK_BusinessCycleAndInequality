# Linear perturbation around steady state

!!! note
    The main functions of this section are in the folder `LinearizationFunctions`.

The model is linearized with respect to aggregate variables. For this,
we write the equilibrium conditions in the form of
``F(X,X')=0``, where ``X`` and ``X'`` are (expected) deviations from steady state
in two successive periods. Applying the total differential yields
``A*X' = - B*X``, where ``A``,``B`` are the first derivatives of ``F`` with respect
to ``X'``,``X``. In the standard setting, we use the generalized Schur decomposition [^Klein]
to transform this equation into a linearized observation equation ``d = gx*k`` and
a linearized state transition equation ``k' = hx*k``, where ``k`` is a vector of the
*state* variables and ``d`` is a vector of the *control* variables (``X = \begin{bmatrix} k \\ d \end{bmatrix}``).

In our code, ``F`` is implemented as [`Fsys()`](@ref), while differentiating and
solving for ``gx`` and ``hx`` is done in [`SGU()`](@ref), and [`linearize_full_model()`](@ref)
returns the results as a `struct` `LinearResults`:

The function executes the following steps:

- generate devices to retrieve distribution and marginal value functions from
    compressed states/controls (`Î“` and `DC`,`IDC`)
- calculate the first derivative of [`Fsys()`](@ref) with respect to `X` and `XPrime`.
    We use automatic differentiation (implemented in Julia by the package `ForwardDiff`).
    Partial derivatives are calculated using the `ForwardDiff.jacobian()` function.
    We exploit that some partial derivatives have known values (contemporaneous marginal value
    functions and the future marginal distributions) and set them directly instead of calculating them [^BL].

- compute linear observation and state transition equations using the [`SolveDiffEq()`](@ref) function

- compute linear observation and state transition equations. The solution algorithm is set
    in `n_par.sol_algo`, with the options `:schur` (mentioned above) and `:litx` [^lit]. The results are matrices that map contemporaneous states to controls [`gx`],
    or contemporaneous states to future states [`hx`]


## Overview of `Fsys()`
```@docs
Fsys
```
The function [`Fsys()`](@ref) proceeds in the following way:
1. set up vector `F`, that contains the errors to all equilibrium conditions. There are as many conditions
    as deviations from steady state (length of `X`,`XPrime`), and conditions are indexed with
    respective model variable in `IndexStruct` `indexes`
2. generate locally all aggregate variables (for both periods) using [`@generate_equations`](@ref)
3. construct the distributions and the marginal value functions from the steady state values
    and the (compressed) deviations
4. write all equilibrium condition-errors with respect to *aggregate* variables to `F`, using
    [`Fsys_agg()`](@ref)
5. compute optimal policies with [`EGM_policyupdate()`](@ref), given
    future marginal value functions, prices, and individual incomes. Infer present marginal
    value functions from them (envelope theorem) and set the difference to assumed present
    marginal value functions (in terms of their compressed deviation from steady state)
    as equilibrium condition-errors (*backward iteration of the value function*)
6. compute future distribution from previous distribution and optimal asset policies. Set
    difference to assumed future marginal distributions as equilibrium condition-errors
    (*forward iteration of the distribution*)
7. compute distribution summary statistics with [`distrSummaries()`](@ref) and write
    equilibrium conditions with their respective (control) variables
8. return `F`

[^BL]:
    Contemporaneous marginal value functions are irrelevant for optimal decisions, so
    its effect on other model variables is 0. Due to a rich enough set of prices, the future distribution
    directly only affects the Fokker-Planck equation. For details, see the paper
    [Solving heterogeneous agent models in discrete time with many idiosyncratic states by perturbation methods](https://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=13071#)

[^lit]:
    Invoking the Implicit Function Theorem, there exist functions ``g`` and ``h`` such that
    ``F\left(\begin{pmatrix} k \\ g(k) \end{pmatrix},\begin{pmatrix} h(k) \\ g(h(k)) \end{pmatrix}\right)=0``.
    Totally differentiating by ``k`` yields ``B \begin{pmatrix}\mathbb{I}\\ Dg \end{pmatrix}+A \begin{pmatrix}\mathbb{I}\\ Dg \end{pmatrix} Dh = 0``. The `:lit`-algorithm solves this equation for ``Dg`` and ``Dh`` iteratively.
